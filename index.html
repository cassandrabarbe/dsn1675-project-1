  <p> My name is Cassandra, Cass for short. I'm a second year graphic design student at Algonquin College. I am 22 years old.
From a young age i loved to paint and draw, I was an artistic kid. My favourite movie is 13 going on 30, this is how i figured out that I wanted to go into graphic design. 
In the movie, the main character works at a magazine compagny and has to redesign the magazine layout, thatâ€™s what i would love to do for AP (alternative press magazine) </p>
